					<p class="information">Manatees are gentle and passive mammals who live in shallow, slow-moving rivers, estuaries, saltwater bays, canals, and coastal areas. Unfortunately, manatees and their habitats are under serious threat from ocean pollution and other human activities. It’s up to us to help protect these peaceful, loveable animals and aid the recovery of their population and habitats around the world.</p>
				<div class="mission">OUR MISSION</div>
					<p class="information1">Our mission is to protect manatees and their aquatic habitat for future generations. Our objective is the recovery and protection of manatees and their aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. In order to recover the manatee population – or delist the species – our goals are: To protect ample healthy habitat to support a stable or growing manatee population, to reduce manatee harassment, injuries and deaths from human activity, and to ensure that sufficient regulations have been adopted to accomplish these goals.<br><br>In order to accomplish our objective and goals we concentrate our efforts on reducing the negative impacts to manatees and their aquatic habitat caused by human activity through: Increasing public awareness and education, sponsoring research, rescue, rehabilitation, and release efforts, advocating for strong protection measures, such as boat speed zones and sanctuaries, and taking legal action when appropriate.We also assist scientists and educators in the Wider Caribbean, South America, and West Africa with their conservation efforts.</p>
